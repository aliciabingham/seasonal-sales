#XHR Seasonal Sales

## Description
Our first AJAX exercise!

In this exercise, we were asked to call two different JSON files: products.json and categories.json. When calling, each category should have 3-4 products inside. There are three buttons at the top containing all possible values of seasonal discounts. When a season is selected, the products in the corresponding category are discounted by the corresponding percentage.

And, for extra credit, all JS is wrapped in an IIFE so it will not be publicly accessible.

Note: Although there is a CSS file, there is VERY minimal styling.

## How to run
In your terminal, run:
```
http-server -p 4040
```
then navigate to http://127.0.0.1:4040 in your browser.
